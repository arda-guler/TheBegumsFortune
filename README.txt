THE BEGUM'S FORTUNE
==========================
A screensaver-ish art piece initially built not to be as such.
Partially inspired by the Verne book of the same name (translated),
but has a bit of a modern touch.

HOW TO RUN
==========================
A) WINDOWS EXECUTABLE
1- Make sure you have begum.exe, the 'data' folder and 'glfw3.dll'
   in the same folder.
2- Run begum.exe.

B) PYTHON SCRIPT
1- Install all required packages
2- Run main.py OR main_with_controls.py (!! controls require
  'keyboard' package, known to be a bit 'touchy' on some systems)
